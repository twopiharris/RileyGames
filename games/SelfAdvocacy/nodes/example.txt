// This file contains the basic structure for making a platformer level with documentation.
// If you copy and paste everything, you'll need to delete any comments (denoted by //) for it to work. To avoid doing this, just copy from the undocumented example: "ex.txt"
// Anything labelled as "optional" can be left out of the level file.
// Anything labelled as "many" means any number of these items can be defined.
// Anything labelled as "saved" means if it is optional and it is not defined for a level, the most recently defined value for the object will be used.
